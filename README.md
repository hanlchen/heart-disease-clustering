We evaluated the performance of two clustering algorithms and examined how various dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques impact our datasets from Assignment 1. Additionally, we explored the combined effects of clustering and DR algorithms to understand how clustering performance is influenced by DR. Finally, we re-applied an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to both post-DR and post-clustered datasets to assess whether these preprocessing steps improved or diminished the ANN modelâ€™s performance. The objective of this assignment is to optimize and analyze the effectiveness of clustering and DR techniques across datasets with diverse structures.
